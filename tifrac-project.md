# The Project to Build a Computer

In 1955, the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research began a bold new experiment: to design and build India’s first digital computer. Led by Homi Bhabha and a small team of physicists and engineers, the project progressed without imported blueprints, relying instead on a self-guided learning curve and sheer ingenuity.

“Our goal,” one designer later wrote, “was to build a machine that compared favorably with computers designed and built elsewhere in the world” (Rao, 424). But it began humbly, with a “pilot model” finished in 1957. This prototype served as a training ground — a proving site for what seemed like “crazy-sounding ideas.”

When Nehru inaugurated the new TIFR building in 1960, he also gave the computer its name: **TIFRAC** — the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research Automatic Calculator.

The machine was designed with an eye to India’s future scientific needs, not just computation for its own sake. Bhabha, echoing a vision aligned with thinkers like John von Neumann, saw computing as essential to India’s “planned economy” and atomic ambitions alike.
