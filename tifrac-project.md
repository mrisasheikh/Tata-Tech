# The Project to Build a Computer

In 1955, TIFR began developing a digital computer under Homi Bhabha. Without international blueprints, engineers created a pilot model by 1957 and a full machine by 1960.

“What we did was to build a ‘pilot model’... a proving ground for our (sometimes crazy-sounding) ideas,” recalled P.V.S. Rao. Nehru named the machine TIFRAC when he inaugurated the new TIFR building.

> *“Our goal... was to build a machine that compared favorably with computers designed and built elsewhere in the world.”*
