# Computing a Nation  
## TIFRAC and the Origins of Indian Computing

In the 1950s, a small team at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research set out to build something no one in India had attempted before: a digital computer, designed and built entirely at home. This website explores the story of **TIFRAC**, India’s first indigenous computer — a machine born from Cold War geopolitics, Nehruvian dreams of self-reliance, and the audacity of scientific imagination.
