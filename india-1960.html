    <h1>India in 1960 — Independence, Cold War, Nehruvian Science</h1>
    <p>
      By 1960, India was a newly independent nation navigating the Cold War and internal development. Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru envisioned science as a foundation of sovereignty. His “scientific temper” shaped centralized planning and institutional investments.

      TIFR, the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, reflected this vision. “The ruling philosophy at that time,” one designer recalled, “was ‘do it here, do it ourselves’” (Rao, 421). Alongside India’s first reactor, another form of power was taking shape: an electronic computer.
