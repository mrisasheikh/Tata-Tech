# What Was TIFRAC?

TIFRAC was no toy. With a 40-bit word length and a core memory of 1024 to 2048 words, it ranked respectably among the early computers of its era. In fact, “its memory cycle time... and 40-bit word length were both higher than the first generation IBM 701” (Chowdhury, 2016).

The computer used a three-dimensional magnetic core memory, a cutting-edge storage technology at the time, and became operational by 1959, serving researchers until 1964. As P.V.S. Rao recalled, “it was NOT a trivial effort... It could well have been a recipe for disaster” (Rao, 424). But the team succeeded, even with limited access to international knowledge or parts.

Yet by the time it was officially named in 1962, TIFRAC had already become a historical artifact — “an obsolete first generation machine” in the words of its own designers (Menon, 452). In the rapidly accelerating world of Cold War computing, even triumphs were fleeting.
